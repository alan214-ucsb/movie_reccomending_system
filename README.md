# movie_reccomending_system

## Project Description:
This project is part of the PSTAT 234 course  and focuses on implementing optimization algorithms using linear algebra techniques for a recommender system. The main objective is to optimize the estimation of user preferences for movies using low-rank matrix factorization.


## Project Structure:
- The project consists of several questions, each focusing on a specific aspect of the optimization algorithms for the recommender system.
- Each question includes instructions, code snippets, and expected solutions.
- The main tasks include implementing update functions for optimization, constructing the optimization algorithm, analyzing diagnostic plots, and making recommendations based on the learned model.
